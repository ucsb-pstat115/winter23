## 1. Trend in Same-sex Marriage

A 2017 Pew Research survey found that 10.2% of LGBT adults in the U.S. were married to a same-sex spouse. Now it’s the 2020s, and Bayard guesses that $\pi$, the percent of LGBT adults in the U.S. who are married to a same-sex spouse, has most likely increased to about 15% but could reasonably range from 10% to 25%.

**1a.** Identify a Beta model that reflects Bayard’s prior ideas about $\pi$ by specifying the parameters of the Beta, $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

```{r}
alpha <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
beta <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q1a.R")
```


**1b.** Bayard wants to update his prior, so he randomly selects 90 US LGBT adults and 30 of them are married to a same-sex partner. What is the posterior model for $\pi$?

```{r}
posterior_alpha <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
posterior_beta <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q1b.R")
```

**1c.** Use R to compute the posterior mean and standard deviation of $\pi$.

```{r}
posterior_mean <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
posterior_sd <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE

print(sprintf("The posterior mean is %f", posterior_mean))
print(sprintf("The posterior sd is %f", posterior_sd))
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q1c.R")
```



**1d.** Does the posterior model more closely reflect the prior information or the data? Explain your reasoning. Hint: in the recorded lecture we showed a special way in which we can write the posterior mean in a Beta-Binomial model.  How can this help? Check the lectures notes.

```{r}

## 2. Cancer Research in Laboratory Mice

A laboratory is estimating the rate of tumorigenesis (the formation of tumors) in two strains of mice, A and B.  They have tumor count data for 10 mice in strain A and 13 mice in strain B.  Type A mice have been well studied, and information from other laboratories suggests that type A mice have tumor counts that are approximately Poisson-distributed. Tumor count rates for type B mice are unknown, but type B mice are related to type A mice. Assuming a Poisson sampling distribution for each group with rates $\theta_A$ and $\theta_B$. Based on previous research you settle on the following prior distribution:

$$ \theta_A \sim \text{gamma}(120, 10),\ \theta_B\sim\text{gamma}(12, 1)$$ 

**2a.** Before seeing any data, which group do you expect to have a higher average incidence of cancer?  Which group are you more certain about a priori? You answers should be based on the priors specified above.

**2b.**  After you the complete of the experiment, you  observe the following tumor counts for the two populations: 

$$y_A = (12,9,12,14,13,13,15,8,15,6)$$
$$y_B = (11,11,10,9,9,8,7,10,6,8,8,9,7)$$
    
Compute the posterior parameters, posterior means, posterior variances and 95% quantile-based credible intervals for $\theta_A$ and $\theta_B$.  Same them in the appropriate variables in the code cell below.  You do not need to show your work, but you cannot get partial credit unless you do show work.

```{r summary_stats, echo=FALSE}
yA <- c(12, 9, 12, 14, 13, 13, 15, 8, 15, 6)
yB <- c(11, 11, 10, 9, 9, 8, 7, 10, 6, 8, 8, 9, 7)

# Prior parameters here
alpha_A = NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
beta_A = NULL # YOUR CODE HERE

alpha_B = NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
beta_B = NULL # YOUR CODE HERE

# Posterior parameters here
alpha_A_posterior = NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
beta_A_posterior = NULL # YOUR CODE HERE

alpha_B_posterior = NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
beta_B_posterior = NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
            
## Posterior mean and variance for each group        
A_post_mean <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
A_post_var <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE

# Posterior quantiles for each group
B_post_mean <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
B_post_var <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE

print(paste0("Posterior mean of theta_A ", round(A_post_mean, 2)))
print(paste0("Posterior variance of theta_A ", round(A_post_var, 2)))
print(paste0("Posterior mean of theta_B ", round(B_post_mean, 2)))
print(paste0("Posterior variance of theta_B ", round(B_post_var, 2)))

# Posterior quantiles
alpha_A_quantile <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
alpha_B_quantile <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE

print(paste0("Posterior 95% quantile for theta_A is [", round(alpha_A_quantile[1],2), ", ", round(alpha_A_quantile[2], 2), "]"))
print(paste0("Posterior 95% quantile for theta_B is [", round(alpha_B_quantile[1],2), ", ", round(alpha_B_quantile[2], 2), "]"))
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q2b.R")
```


        
**2c.** Compute and plot the posterior expectation of $\theta_B$ given $y_B$ under the prior distribution  $\text{gamma}(12\times n_0, n_0)$ for each value of $n_0 \in \{1,2,...,50\}$. As a reminder, $n_0$ can be thought of as the number of prior observations (or pseudo-counts).  

```{r}

# YOUR CODE HERE

posterior_means = NULL # YOUR CODE HERE

# YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q2c.R")
```



**2d.** Should knowledge about population A tell us anything about population B? Discuss whether or not it makes sense to have $p(\theta_A, \theta_B) = p(\theta_A) \times p(\theta_B)$.

## 3. Soccer World cup
Let $\lambda$ be the expected number of goals scored in a Women’s World Cup game. We’ll analyze $\lambda$ by the following a $Y_i$ is the observed number of goals scored in a sample of World Cup games:
\[Y_i | \lambda  \stackrel{ind}{\sim} \text{Pois}(\lambda) \]

You and your friend argue about a more reasonable prior for $\lambda$.    You think that $p_1(\lambda)$ with a $\text{gamma}(8, 2)$ density is a reasonable prior. Your friend thinks that $p_2(\lambda)$ with a $\text{gamma}(2, 1)$ density is a reasonable prior distribution.  You decide that each of you are equally credible in your prior assessments and so you combine your prior distributions into a mixture prior with equal weights: $p(\lambda) = 0.5 * p_1(\lambda) + 0.5 * p_2(\lambda)$

**3a.** Which of you thinks more goals will be scored on average? Which of you is more confident in that assessment a priori?

**3b.** Plot the combined prior density, $p(\lambda)$, that you and your friend have created.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

**3c.** Why might the Poisson model be a reasonable model for our data $Y_i$? In what ways might this model for $Y_i$ be too simple?

**3c.** The `wwc_2019_matches` data in the *fivethirtyeight* package includes the number of goals scored by the two teams in each 2019 Women’s World Cup match. Create a histogram of the number of goals scored per game.  What is the maximum likelihood estimate for the expected number of goals scored in a game? You do not need to show your work for computing the MLE.

```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data("wwc_2019_matches")
wwc_2019_matches <- wwc_2019_matches %>% 
  mutate(total_goals = score1 + score2)

## This is your y_i
total_goals <- wwc_2019_matches$total_goals
```

```{r}
soccer_mle <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
```

**3d.** Write the posterior distribution up to a proportionality constant by multiplying the likelihood and the combined prior density created by you and your friend. Plot this unnormalized posterior distribution and add a vertical line at the MLE computed in the previous part. _Warning:_ be very careful about what constitutes a proportionality constant in this example.

**3e.** Based on the plot above would you say that the prior had a large impact on conclusions or only a small one? Reference pseudo-counts and the proposed prior to argue why it makes sense that the prior did or did not have a big effect.
